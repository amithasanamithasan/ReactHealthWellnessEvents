##Definitions of health and wellness: Health is the state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease, or infirmity. Wellness is an active process through which people become aware of, and make choices toward, a more successful existence.
This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.
